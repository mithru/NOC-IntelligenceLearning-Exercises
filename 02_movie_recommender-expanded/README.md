I tried running the [movie recommender example](https://github.com/shiffman/NOC-S17-2-Intelligence-Learning/tree/master/week3-classification-regression/02_movie_recommender) to work with the larger [movielens dataset](https://github.com/shiffman/NOC-S17-2-Intelligence-Learning/tree/master/week3-classification-regression/movielens_data/data). This is still a work in progress. The biggest issue is the size of the data. I worked towards converting the dataset as close as possible to the smaller dataset (not a good idea).
Overall, this was a good exercise to revise what we covered in the previous class. 

The picture below shows movie recommendations based on my choices. At the moment, it only shows the movie's ID and not the name (still WIP - I might redo the whole thing at some point).
